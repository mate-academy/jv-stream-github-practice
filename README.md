# Stream practice

1.  Given the list of strings where each element contains 1+ numbers:
    ```input = {"5,30,100", "0, 22, 7", ...}```
    return a min integer value. One more thing - we're interested in even numbers.
    If there is no needed data throw `RuntimeException` with the message "Can't get min value from list: method_input_list".
    
2.  Given a List of Integer numbers,
    subtract 1 from each element on an odd position (having the odd index).
    Then return the average of all odd numbers or throw NoSuchElementException.

3.  Given a List of `People` instances (having `name`, `age`, and `sex` fields),
    for example, `Arrays.asList( new People(«Victor», 16, Sex.MAN), new People(«Helen», 42, Sex.WOMEN))`,
    select from the List only men whose age is from `fromAge` to `toAge` inclusively.
    Example: select men who can be recruited to the army (from 18 to 27 years old inclusively).
    
4.  Given a List of `People` instances (having `name`, `age`, and `sex` fields),
    for example, `Arrays.asList( new People(«Victor», 16, Sex.MAN), new People(«Helen», 42, Sex.WOMEN))`,
    select from the List only people whose age is from `fromAge` and to `maleToAge` (for men)
    or to `femaleToAge` (for women) inclusively.
    Example: select people of working age
    (from 18 y.o. and to 60 y.o. for men and to 55 y.o. for women inclusively).

5.  Given a List of `People` instances (having `name`, `age`, `sex` and `List<Cat> cats` fields,
    and each `Cat` having a `name` and `age`),
    return the names of all cats whose owners are women from `femaleAge` years old inclusively.

6.  Your help with an election is needed. Given a list of candidates, where each element has Candidate.class type.
    Check which candidates are eligible to apply for the president position and return their names sorted alphabetically.
    The requirements are: person should be at least 35 years old, should be allowed to vote, have nationality - 'Ukrainian'
    and lived in Ukraine for 10 years. For the last requirement use the field periodsInUkr, which has the following view:
    "2002-2015" For now we don't care if that was the last 10 or not. We want to reuse our validation in the future, so
    let's write our own implementation of Predicate<Candidate> in CandidateValidator.
